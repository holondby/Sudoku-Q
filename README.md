# Sudoku-Q

The Sudoku-Q algorithm solves standard Sudoku puzzles of any complexity. Moreover, the algorithm (which uses q-learning) usually generates its solution fairly quickly. The Sudoku-Q Notebook documents the learning trials required to converge on a solution, for the 40 puzzles discussed.  All 40 of the puzzles explored, plus the test.txt dataset discused in the Notebook, are found in the Datasets folder.

All of the original files and data can be found in the "master" branch of this project.
