# Sudoku-Q

The Sudoku-Q algorithm solves standard Sudoku puzzles of any complexity (so far at least). The algorithm uses q-learning to generate a solution. The Sudoku-Q Notebook documents the learning trials required to converge on a solution for the 40 puzzles explored.  All 40 of the puzzles discussed, as well as the 'test.txt' dataset discused in the Notebook, are found in the Datasets folder.

The Print_Dictionary application displays the contents of the dictionary. It should be used with care, however, when run against a large memory, the program can generate substantial screen output.
