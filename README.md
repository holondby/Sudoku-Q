# Sudoku-Q

The Jupyter Notebook in the master branch solves standard Sudoku puzzles of any complexity. Moreover, the algorithm, which uses q-learning to generate its solution, generally learns very quickly. The Notebook documents the learning trials required to converge on a solution for the 40 puzzles discussed.  All 40 of the puzzles explored, plus the test.txt dataset discused in the Notebook, are found in the "Datasets" folder.
