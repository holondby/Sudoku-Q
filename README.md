# Sudoku-Q

The Sudoku-Q algorithm solves standard Sudoku puzzles of any complexity. Moreover, the algorithm (which uses q-learning) usually generates its solution fairly quickly. The Notebook documents the learning trials required to converge on a solution for the 40 puzzles discussed.  All 40 of the puzzles explored, plus the test.txt dataset discused in the Notebook, are found in the "Datasets" folder.
